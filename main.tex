\begin{abstract}
Number Theory is quite simply the study of integers. This course analyzes some interesting relationships between integers, and the implications of these relationships. You are expected to be familiar with what was taught in MATH 135, including but not limited to, \textit{linear Diophantine equations, euclidean algorithm, congruence} and the \textit{Chinese remainder theorem.}
